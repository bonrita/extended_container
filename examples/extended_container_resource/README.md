# Example: Resource exclude keywords

This example demostrates making all classes in your module folder services automatically.

It also shows how you can exclude those classes that you do not want to automatically become services.

In this example you notice that all the manual work that was done in the example module
 'extended_container_example_autoconfigure' to register services, all that was skipped
 but yet archiving the same result with less lines in the service definition.
